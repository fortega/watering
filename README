This is and arduino / python proyect.
It sense the soil moisture and autowater.
I build it using the cheapest sensors and relay board y found in ebays.
I will include an cheap "permanent solution" using a cheap perfboard and one Ardunio Pro Micro (SparkFun design).

This software (as all the software used to make this) is GPL license. Fell free to use it!
